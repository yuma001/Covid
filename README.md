Covid data

# Data source
Downloaded csv file from Our World Data which shows covid-19 cases. The link to the source is https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases.

# Tools
In order to clean data, I used VS code to write python script and used Tableau for data visualisation. Please find the published Tableau visualisation [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidData_17049996747950/Sheet1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
