Covid data

# Data source
Downloaded csv file from Our World Data which shows covid-19 cases. The link to the source is https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases.

# Tools
In order to clean data, I used VS code to write python script and used Tableau for data visualisation. Please find the published Tableau visualisation here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yuma.r/viz/CovidData_17049996747950/Sheet1).
